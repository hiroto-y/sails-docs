# sails.config.session

### What is this?
Sails session integration leans heavily on the great work already done by Express, but also unifies Socket.io with the Connect session store.

### Description


Sails session integration leans heavily on the great work already done by Express, but also unifies 
Socket.io with the Connect session store. It uses Connect&rsquo;s cookie parser to normalize configuration
differences between Express and Socket.io and hooks into Sails&rsquo; middleware interpreter to allow you
to access and auto-save to `req.session` with Socket.io the same way you would with Express.

#### `secret`
Session secret is automatically generated when your new app is created.
Replace at your own risk in production-- you will invalidate the cookies of your users, forcing them to log in again. 

### `key`
Session key is set as `sails.sid` by default.
This is the name used in the cookie to recover the session.

If you are runing multiple instances of sails, you can lost your session with Websocket.
Replace key by an unique name, solve this issue.

#### Shared Redis session store
In production, uncomment the following line to set up a shared redis session store
that can be shared across multiple Sails.js servers.
```javascript
adapter: 'redis',
```

The following values are optional, if no options are set a redis instance running
on localhost is expected.
Read more about options at: https://github.com/visionmedia/connect-redis
```javascript
        host: 'localhost',
        port: 6379,
        ttl: <redis session TTL in seconds>,
        db: 0,
        pass: <redis auth password>
        prefix: 'sess:'
```

Uncomment the following lines to use your Mongo adapter as a session store
```javascript
        adapter: 'mongo',

        host: 'localhost',
        port: 27017,
        db: 'sails',
        collection: 'sessions',
```

Optional Values:
```javascript
        // Note: url will override other connection settings
        // url: 'mongodb://user:pass@host:port/database/collection',

        username: '',
        password: '',
        auto_reconnect: false,
        ssl: false,
        stringify: true

```
